# Goal
Evaluate the total number of pies you can make with the apples in your bowl

# Relevant Given Information
- Even number of fruits in your bowl
- Half of the fruits are bananas

# Inputs
1. Total amount of fruit in your bowl

# Execution
Determine the amount of apples in the bowl

$$
numberOfApples = \frac{totalFruits}{2}
$$

Determine how many pies you can make from the amount of apples. Three apples make one pie

$$
numberOfPies = \frac{numberOfApples}{3}
$$

## Alternative
$$
\frac{\frac{totalFruits}{2}}{3} \Rightarrow \frac{totalFruits}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} \Rightarrow \frac{totalFruits}{6}
$$
