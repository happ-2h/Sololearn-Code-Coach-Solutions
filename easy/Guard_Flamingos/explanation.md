Find out how many flamingos you need to purchase

# Relevant Given Information
- Add a flamingo every 2 feet on the perimeter

# Inputs
1. Length of the yard
1. Width of the yard

# Execution
Find the perimeter of the yard

$$
perimeter = 2 \times (length + width)
$$

One flamingo must be placed every two feet

$$
totalFlamingos = \frac{perimeter}{2}
$$

## Alternative
$$
\frac{2 \times (length + width)}{2} \Rightarrow length + width
$$

### Benefits
- Saves a multiplication and division
