# Sololearn Code Coach Solutions

My code solutions to the Sololearn Code Coach coding challenges, alongside explanations on how I executed the solution.

The objective of this repository is to aide others that are stuck on a problem attain some clarification, or reach a definite conclusion; therefore, it is highly recommended to first refer to the explanations before the code solutions.

Most solutions are in C; however, I may add other unsupported languages for fun.

> [!NOTE]
> The unsupported languages have not been tested against Sololearn's hidden test cases.

> [!WARNING]
> The code was not made for production
